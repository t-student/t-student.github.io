      <description>If you have multiple treatment options that lead to different outcomes, you will only be able to detect a difference in the average outcome under conditions where there is sufficient statistical power to do so. Statistical power is the probability that we detect an effect when there really is an effect to be detected. As statistical power increases the probability of making a Type II error (concluding there is no effect when, in fact, there is one) decreases.</description>
