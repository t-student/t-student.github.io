      <description>Context Logistic regression can be used as a classifier for a dichotomous outcomes (live/die), but ultimately you need to specify the threshold probability that demarcates outcomes.
The SMPracticals R package contains bliss, a dataset detailing the number of adult flour beetles which died following a 5-hour exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide. Here the outcomes are died versus lived, with died as the success evemt. The data is aggregated showing number of beetles that died at a given dose, but we the individual trials.</description>

      <description>Imagine you are in the perilous and life threatening situation of being asked to generate random numbers. Compounding the peril is that we have also been asked to ensure that the probability of choosing a given number is linearly proportional to its magnitude.
OK, let&amp;rsquo;s start by imagining what the probability density function will look like - probably something list this:
The area under the pdf must integrate to 1 so if the pdf is a linearly increasing function with support (arbitrarily say) 0 to 3.</description>

      <title>Simulating Lung Cancer Incidence data in R</title>

      <description>The world is now awash in data, but sometimes it is useful to roll your own. For example, you may to look at &amp;lsquo;what if&amp;rsquo; scenarios. Here I use publically available information on the age-class-distribution, rates of smoking and incidence of smoking to form a dataset that we will use in a later modelling exercise. In order to do this I use the simstudy and data.table R packages.
Distribution of lung cancer incidence in Australia The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare publish incidence and mortality data.</description>
