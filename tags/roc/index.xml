      <description>Context Logistic regression can be used as a classifier for a dichotomous outcomes (live/die), but ultimately you need to specify the threshold probability that demarcates outcomes.
The SMPracticals R package contains bliss, a dataset detailing the number of adult flour beetles which died following a 5-hour exposure to gaseous carbon disulphide. Here the outcomes are died versus lived, with died as the success evemt. The data is aggregated showing number of beetles that died at a given dose, but we the individual trials.</description>
