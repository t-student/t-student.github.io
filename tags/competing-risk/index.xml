      <description>Competing risk happen when you have multiple risks that can distort your analysis of some measure. For example, if you are trying to estimate the time to relapse of a disease some patients will be censored by loss to follow up or the study ending, others may die. Time to relapse and death are competing risks.
When analysing CR we use cumulative incidence. Cumulative incidence is just the probability of an event by a particular time.</description>
